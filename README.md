# AIMA — From Scratch Implementations

This repository contains from-scratch implementations of core Artificial Intelligence concepts based on *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (4th Edition)*.

The goal of this project is to deeply understand problem formulation, search, reasoning, planning, and decision-making by implementing algorithms from first principles rather than relying on high-level AI/ML libraries.

This repository is intended as a long-term, evolving codebase that mirrors the conceptual structure of AIMA while maintaining clean and reusable abstractions.
